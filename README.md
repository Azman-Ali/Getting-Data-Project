# Getting-Data-Project

This repository is dedicated to the Coursera Module 3 Project Assignment on Getting Data

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

This repository contains :  
* README files,
* CodeBook and 
* run_analysis.R

## Codebook
This file contain the description of all variables

## run_analysis.R
This script was tasked for the following :

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How the Script works
The script run_analysis.R can be run from R console without any input parameters.
Briefly script will process raw data based on following sequence :
* Import library plyr
* Create a directory "data" as its workspace
* Automatically Download raw data from the data sources (refer above link)
* (Note that the data will be downloaded as a .zip file, user needs to manually unzip this file in data directory (maintaining all file path from the zip file (/Datasets/UCI HAR Dataset/)
* The script will transform  identified files into table (subject_test, subject train,X_test, y_test, X_train and y_train) and subsequently merged them into a single dataset
* The script will Extract only with mean and Std Deviation following which, it will relabel activities from respective code to description (such as 1=WALKING etc)
* The first dataset(TidayDataset1) will then be produced
* The second dataset (TidyDataset2) will be created, showing only the average value based on id and activities

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
